# CSC437
there are no special commands needed to run the code.

addendum:
I probably overestimated the ammount of time I could spend on this project this quarter, which resutled in me not being able to make a coherent app. I think that the complexity of my backend bogged me down result in me not being able to create a decent frontend. While the views don't really work, I still have the basics such auth and a single page app. I think if a had a bit more time I could better develop my views and create a more coherent backend.
